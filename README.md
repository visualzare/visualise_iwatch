# Visualise iWatch

Visualise data from your Apple Watch

## Information 

The goal of this script is to extract datas from the export.xml file generated on your iPhone, and to visualise data in a creative way. 
Currently, you can only visualise Average Heartbeat and Steps per day. 
The only visualisation available is a "barcode" where one trait is one day, and the colour depends on the value of the date. 

The color code is this one :

* Black : the highest value
* White : the lowest value

Every other values are on a gradient between white and black. 

## First step : get your export.xml 

* Open your Health app (on iPhone) and click on your profile picture in the top-right corner.
* Select [Export All Health Data], which appears at the bottom of the menu.
* After a few minutes, you can send the exported datas to your computer using mail or airdrop. 

## Improvements are more than welcome

Feel free to use this script, upgrade it or adapt it depending on your will.
